objective:Grant super user access  and revoke super user access and user

Step 1
To create a new user account on kali
Our company just hired a new staff member named David. As part of the onboarding process, we need to create a user account for him on our Kali Linux system so he can log in and start working.

STEP2
After months of hard work, David has proven himself valuable. Management has decided to promote him to a system administrator role, which means he should have sudo privileges.

STEP3
Unfortunately, David has decided to resign and move to another company. As part of our offboarding process, we must revoke his admin privileges to ensure he no longer has elevated access.

STEP4
Finally, since david no longer works with us, we must remove his account entirely from the system to close the lifecycle of his employment.

conclusion

This scenario demonstrates a full user lifecycle management workflow in Kali Linux: onboarding, privilege escalation, de-escalation, and termination â€” wrapped in a real-world storytelling approach that reflects HR and IT collaboration.
Conclusion & Summary

In this project, we followed the lifecycle of a user in a corporate environment using Kali Linux. We simulated the journey of David, a staff member who was hired, promoted, resigned, and then had his account terminated.

Onboarding: We created a new user profile for David.

Privilege Escalation: We granted him administrative (sudo) rights when he was promoted.

Privilege De-escalation: We revoked those rights after his resignation.

Termination: We deleted his account and home directory to fully remove his presence from the system
